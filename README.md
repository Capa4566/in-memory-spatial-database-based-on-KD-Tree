The original dataset: [Assignment2-2012_BIT_POI.csv](https://github.com/Capa4566/in-memory-spatial-database-based-on-KD-Tree/files/15234269/Assignment2-2012_BIT_POI.csv)  

## Main Task
1. Build an in-memory spatial database for Point of Interest (POI) that can support the spatial range query and the nearest neighbor query. 
2. Demonstrate the efficiency of the spatial index.
3. Compare the efficiency of different queries with/without the spatial index.  

## Solution
The solution is shown in Report.ipynb
